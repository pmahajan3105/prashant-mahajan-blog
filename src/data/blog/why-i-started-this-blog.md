## Why I Started This Blog

After 8+ years in product management and building products across different stages - from early-stage startups to enterprise-level solutions - I've accumulated a wealth of frameworks, lessons, and insights that I believe can help other product builders.

### The Problem I'm Solving

The product management space is flooded with theoretical content, but there's a gap in practical, battle-tested insights. Most content either:

- Focuses on generic frameworks without real-world context
- Lacks the startup perspective where resources are limited
- Doesn't address the day-to-day challenges PMs actually face

### What You'll Find Here

This blog is my attempt to bridge that gap. I'll be sharing:

**Product Management Frameworks**
- RICE prioritization in practice (with real examples)
- Jobs-to-be-Done implementation strategies
- MVP validation techniques that actually work
- Data-driven decision making frameworks

**Startup Journey Insights**
- Early-stage validation methods I've used
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Resource allocation strategies for lean teams
- Customer discovery insights and techniques

**Tool Reviews & Recommendations**
- Product management software comparisons
- Analytics tools that provide actionable insights
- Project management solutions for different team sizes

**Industry Analysis**
- Market trends I'm tracking
- Competitive intelligence frameworks
- Technology adoption patterns

### My Approach

Every piece of content here will be:

1. **Practical** - Based on real experience, not just theory
2. **Actionable** - You can implement these insights immediately
3. **Honest** - Including failures and what I learned from them
4. **Data-driven** - Supported by metrics and outcomes where possible

### What Makes This Different

I'm not just writing from the perspective of someone who's "made it." I'm actively building products, facing the same challenges you are, and learning new things every day. This blog is as much about my continued learning journey as it is about sharing what I already know.

### Let's Build Better Products Together

Product management is ultimately about solving real problems for real people. Whether you're a fellow PM, entrepreneur, or someone interested in building products that matter, I hope you'll find value in these insights.

I'm always open to discussions, feedback, and learning from your experiences too. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prashantmahajan31/) or via [email](mailto:pm@zeda.io).

Let's build something great together.
